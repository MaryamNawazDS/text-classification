# text-classification

The project focuses on exploring how machine learning tools within Scikit-Learn can be applied to perform text classification. Specifically, the task involves categorizing author profiles as either female or male, known as gender identification.

For this task, we will utilize the PAN-AP-16 Twitter Corpus dataset. This dataset contains 426 author profiles, with 215 female profiles and 211 male profiles. Each profile is stored in a separate file and includes tweets in plain text format, already pre-processed. Female profiles are organized in one directory and male profiles in another.
